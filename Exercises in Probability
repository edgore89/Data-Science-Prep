P(HTTH) = .5 * .5 * .5 * .5 = 0.0625 , P(HHHH) = .5 * .5 * .5 * .5= 0.0625, P(TTHH) = .5 * .5 * .5 *.5= 0.0625
P(Not a man) = P(choosing a woman)= 24/45
P(Bernice will travel and be in plane crash) = 0.1 * 0.0005 = 0.00005 or 0.0005% 4)The odds of getting survey will increase as people spend more time on different websites.
#Drill - Exercises in Bayes' Rule

P(Positive)= .98 * .005 + .1 * .995 = .1044
P(Correctly diagnose a sufferer of Thripshaw’s) = .98
P(Correctly identify a non-sufferer of Thripshaw’s) = 1 - .1 = .9
P(Misclassify the person) = 1-(.98 *. 005 + .9 * .995) = .0996
#Evaluating data sources

Data of the ABnB in Amsterdam on Dec. 24th is not a good overwall representation of the data because it is around Christmas time. It would be better to choose sample data that is related to a holiday.
Sept 12th, 2001 was the day after 9/11, so this would give biased data and there would be a major difference in comparing the mental health service usage between New York and San Francisco. Choosing a diffenrent time period to ask this question would deliver unbiased results.
The Armenian Students in this survey are also students. The question could be changed to "Why do students visit pubs?" or keep the same question and not include students.
#Beware of Monty Hall P(Winning) = 1/3 P(Losing) = 2/3

If you switch after picking the wrong door: P(Winning) = 2 /3 P(Losing) = 1/3

The chance of winning after switching is greater because if you pick the wrong door, then that narrows down the choices of the picking the right door.
